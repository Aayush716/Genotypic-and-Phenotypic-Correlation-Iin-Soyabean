# Genomic selection using deep learning and saliency map

We provide a deep-learning method to predict five quantitative traits (Yield, Protein, Oil, Moisture and Plant height) of Soyabean dataset.
We also applied feature importance to measure phenotype contribution for genome wide association study. 
The program is implemented using ML Approaches

Highlights of models
1) Support Vector Regression
2) My varaint of SVR from scratch
3) Attention + SVR
4) Kernel ridge regression

In my research, I transformed genotypic data for analysis and applied machine learning techniques, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and deep learning with a ResNet architecture. These methods were compared with statistical approaches to identify Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs)â€”soybean SNPs potentially linked to key phenotypic traits like oil content. This combination of machine learning and statistical analysis offered valuable insights into genetic markers, contributing to advancements in agricultural genetics.

### Prerequisites

Python packages are required,

```
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
keras
scipy
sklearn
matplotlib
```
## Running the program

The scripts train and test model with 10 fold cross validation and plot a comparison of genotype contribution using saliency map value and Wald test value.

Below is the code for CNN

Similarly code for Random Forest and SVR is inside folder MY ML Approaches.


```
cd HEIGHT
python height.py

```
